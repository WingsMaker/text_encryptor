# text_encryptor
Wrote my own webapp for text encryption such that you can share a QR code of the encryption key.
No need internet access, clean codes.
Can be used for those company laptop with restricted access.

Background
                Company information via email or chat often has the possibility to reach out to vendors, it is safer to apply text encryption at group/individual level.
                So that only closed group members or individual can access to the original information. The risk of information leak incidents can be mitigated.
                Even the encryption keys were at risk if using unknown 3rd party application. Do you know the WHATSAPP group end-to-end encryption key? 
                ( worse if people using unsafe 3rd party app over internet )
